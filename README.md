### WTF?
If you're like me, then your longtime dream has been to take over all the computers in your office and make them play hysterical laughter and/or other crazy noises. Sure, there are all manner of underground "back orifice" type tools out there that can take over a computer, but until now, there wasn't something simple and disposable that you could use in your office without causing headaches further down the road when you have to uninstall some crazy trojan horse.

No... that's too much effort/risk for a stupid prank. Still, the idea of a ghost in the machine has haunted me for some time.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051024040902/http://officepoltergeist.com/">Way back in 2005</a>, I built a primitive version of OfficePoltergeist for Windows, and, while it was hard to use, it was quite a big hit. Even now, when you search for "Computer Prank," the memory of the OfficePoltergeist remains perserved in the handful of articles which cover that topic. 

Almost immediately after launch, the Windows OfficePoltergeist, which was written in a macro language called "AutoIt" and compiled into an application, ended up on some analyst's desk at every one of anti virus makers. They promptly flagged OfficePoltergeist as a trojan horse... which I guess it kind of was. A nice trojan horse. 

At any rate, I ran out of time to work on OfficePoltergeist. It was a stupid project that, while somewhat novel, didn't really warrant any more attention than I'd already given it. I let the domain expire. The dream died a bit. I never did come up with a coherent way to bring the whole thing together in such a way that was easy and fun for users.

In the intervening decade, I became a reasonably competent developer for a major corporation, but, often, the puzzle of OfficePoltergeist would visit me in dreams. How can I make it easy and fun to haunt a computer? What tools do I have at my disposal?

My dreams are now your reality. We can now channeling the spirit world through websockets. Like the famous spiritual manifestation which derives its power from the scene of a terrible crime, OfficePoltergeist runs within Chrome itself. 

OfficePoltergeist uses ssl and <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> to manage communication back to a Central Poltergeist Server. Think of it like the ghost storage unit in Ghostbusters, except a lot more like a cheap virtual machine in some datacenter somewhere.
